# Neural-Modeling-Manual Section 2
## This section will focus on the different types of single cells and the properties. It will show how to model a single cell to be used in a network. It will also show an example of how to check single cell properties using the bmtool package. 

## We may put some S lab stuff in here like S1,S2,S3 and LA cell(with LTO, HTO) given specs from user ie passive props(Vest, Rin, Tau) and FI curve. How do we tune a cell to have these props. What each channel does to a cell. 

## Cell types to include LA model cells (PNa, PNc, PV, SOM, (CR LATER), M1 cells (CP,CS,FSI,LTS) HIPPO CELLS LATER

## Do we want detail single cell stuff in here? or at least an intro and bring up the idea. Is there a way we could show Ca spikes, Na spikes, NMDA spikes easily?

## Building on single cell cover Ben's model which will be at the end of section as an advanced topic.

## other sections will use single cells models from here as examples.
