# Neural-Modeling-Manual Chapter 3
## When trying to design a synpase there are many factors the need to be included some of which are tau rise time(τr), tau decay(τd) time, short-term plasicity(STP) and long-term plasicity(LTP). This section will walk through all of these topics and give both infomation and code examples. there will be notebook with each topic found in this folder. Could bring up ossilations and the importance of STP, and time constants or could wait till network design. Tyler amygdala network is an example of a network with neuromodulation.

## could also talk about the small differences in modeling AMPA/NMDA vs GABA synapse along with perhaps putting several different example synapses from basic background synapses to complex STP/LTP AMPA/NMDA synapses. Could also make a CyNeuro repo to hold a bunch of these synapses then just reference them here. Kind of like the channel repo we were building on CyNeuro
