# Neural-Modeling-Manual Chapter 5
## This folder is for all things network model design. Things like connection rules and ossilation design. Have an example of a simple PING model and then bring up the importance of time contstants. 

## A good thing to focus on could be how Ziao designed the M1. A notebook explaining the important of recipical/bi-directional connections could be good. Also sommething explaining the difference between a netconn weight and a weight inside a mod file could be important.
