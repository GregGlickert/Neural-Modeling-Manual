# Neural-Modeling-Manual Chapter 6
## Several exammples for how to process the output of a simulation. Some examples will be LFP analysis(FOOOF, Ziao's code, heatmaps), correalation of neurons spiking, generating rasters, phase timeing of cells(Hilbert transform).

# Random notebook ideas flushed out a bit
## Fooof. Gen sigal using fooof and then showoff how to use it. Need to show how to compare two different signels
## For correalation dont have to use real data can use fake data to show lag time between two "neurons"

## detail SINGLE CELL codes TO COME
