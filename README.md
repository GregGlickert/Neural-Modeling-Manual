# Neural-Modeling-Manual Overview
# Once we start fininshing notebook and putting them in place here we will move the incomplete notebooks to the under development section. This will help us keep track of what needs to be worked on still. For now we dont need to worry about this cause every notebook is under development.

# TO DO KHURAM
## Finish chap2-short-term-plasicity notebook use this [link](https://github.com/tjbanks/synaptic_plasticity/tree/master) as a guide as to kinda what to do and also have this in that chapter as well. We want both forms of STP documented in the manual. Can be put into two different notebooks.
## Put the notebooks you worked on at first into the single cell chapter
#
# There are also ideas for notebooks in each README in each chapter that need to be added if you finish these before i have time to review your work

## Increasingly high-resolution biological data related to neurons, including their connectivity are continuing to emerge in the literature. The methods of research, however, are often in vitro and do not offer behavioral explanations at the network level. With knowledge of this level of detail and the need for network level studies, computer simulations offer a cost-effective hypothesis testing environment to study cellular and systems level behaviors of interest to the neuroscientist. With the tremendous and growing, albeit disjoint biological literature, network modelling can be a daunting task. Where do you start? How do you implement a model? This manual aims to answer these questions and serve as a general guide for modeling large scale biophysically realistic networks. The repo is divided into 6 chapters covering the big picture, implementation, and examples. Each chapter aims to cover a different part of modeling a biophysical neural network using the [Neuron simulation](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) and the [Brain modeling toolkit](https://alleninstitute.github.io/bmtk/) with network analysis being done using python examples and python package [BMtool](https://github.com/tjbanks/bmtool)

### Chapter 1 - [Getting started with modeling](/Chapter-1-Getting-started-with-modeling)

#### This section will walk though the very basic and go into the details about how to set up an evironment for network modeling.

### Chapter 2 - [Single-cells](/Chapter-2-Single-cells)

#### This section will go into details about proper single cell modeling

### Chapter 3 - [Synaptic-Design](/Chapter-3-Synaptic-Design)

#### This section will go into details about synaptic design

### Chapter 4 - [Input Design](/Chapter-4-Input-Design)

#### This section will go into details of designing extrinsic inputs to a network

### Chapter 5 - [Building Networks](/Chapter-5-Building-Networks) 

#### This section will go into details about network design 

### Chapter 6 [Model post processing](/Chapter-6-Model-post-processing) 

#### This section will contain several different methods used to process the output of a neural network.
