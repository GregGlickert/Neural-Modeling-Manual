# Network-Modeling-Manual
## This section will focus on the different types of single cells and the properties. It will show how to model a single cell to be used in a network. It will also show an example of how to check single cell properties using the bmtool package. 

We may put some S lab stuff in here like S1,S2,S3.
Do we want detail single cell stuff in here? or at least an intro and bring up the idea. Is there a way we could show Ca spikes, Na spikes, NMDA spikes easily?
