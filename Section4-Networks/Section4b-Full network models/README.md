# Neural-Modeling-Manual Network examples

## Examples would include distance dependent and homogenous comparisons

## Examples would be 1000 cell LA(baseline gamma model, tone+shock, comp with winners and losers, Fear with CS+ and CS-, beaming Theta)

## M1(L5,L2/3) exmaples as well 

## compare gamma char across brain regions. How do the prop(gamma, beta, connectivity, etc)  changes across regions. 

## ossilations PING network and PINB and how time constants control with STP
